HINTS FOR COMFORT.</h2>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 65px;">
<img src="images/doodad2.jpg" width="65" height="10" alt="decorative line" />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first thing to parties bent on roughing
it is the selection of a tent, which can be
hired of any of the sail-makers, for any
length of time, and at a reasonable price.
For a party of seven or eight, an eight-foot
wall-tent, is the best. Dig a trench around
the outside to avoid nocturnal baptism the
first time it rains. The beds can be comfortably
arranged in the rear of the tent, by
laying rubber blankets on the ground; on
which lay boards slightly raised for the head,
and sloping to the ground at the foot. These
beds should be placed so that the persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
will lie with their heads at the sides of the
tent and feet toward the center. On the
boards spread straw, hay, or dry seaweed,
then the blankets. Every thing used about
the bed should be laid in the sun every day.
Some prefer sleeping on the ground rolled
up in a blanket; but this is imprudent, except
in very dry localities.</p>

<p>The next important thing is the stove.
The top of a common cooking-stove with
covers and stove-pipe to fit, which can be
bought at any junk-shop for a trifle, serves
very well in dry weather. Dig out a place
in the side of a bank the size and shape
of the stove-top, about two feet deep, and
line three sides with brick or stones, with
the front open. Regulate the draught
by placing something in front for a
blower.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The Lexington Camping-Stove</span>,” (which
is the neatest, the most compact and convenient
thing of the kind I ever saw), gotten
up by the “Lexington Botanical Club”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
for their own use is just the article for camp.
It is a box-stove, made of sheet iron,
light, and quickly set up or taken down.
It fits into a wooden chest which is thirty
inches long, sixteen and a half deep, and
fifteen broad. Into the stove fits a large
water-tank; and, into the tank and one end
of the stove, fit all the utensils for cooking
and serving. When the stove is set up, the
chest answers for a closet for stores, and
also for a seat. This outfit is not prepared
for the market by theorists who only guess at
the wants of the camper, but has been
studied out by gentlemen and ladies who,
every year, spend months in the mountains,
and who try to have all the comforts and
conveniences possible, and yet to have very
little baggage to transport from place to
place. They have been using a similar
stove for years; and we now have the result
of continued improvements in the most perfect
form of it. At my request, they have
permitted their model to be used for the
forming of others. They are made and for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
sale by J. A. Johnson, No. 5 Norfolk Place
(opposite the Adams House). The whole
cost of box, stove, and utensils will not exceed
eighteen dollars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kerosene Oil Stoves</span> are sometimes preferable,
for they are easily transported, and
can be used in wet or dry weather. The
“Boston Gem,” made by Francis Morandi,
No. 102 Union Street, I find, after
a thorough trial, works to a charm; the
oven baking as well as my stove oven. The
broiler is so made that there is no difficulty
in broiling with it. When in the woods,
if possible, I would have a good bed of
coals for broiling.</p>

<p>In regard to <span class="smcap">Cooking Utensils</span>, coffee
and tea pots should not have spouts, but
lips: and the lips should be riveted on.
It is foolish for a party going any distance
to try to carry crockery. Have tin plates
and cups made, and they will last you for
all your camping life. They can be kept
clean by occasionally scouring them with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
sand if on the beach, and with ashes if in
the mountains; or, what is still better, with
Sapolio, which rub on a cloth and then rub
the tin with the cloth. Four or six cakes
of this will give you much comfort and
neatness. If you can carry a farina kettle
with you, and you use it with care, it
will be almost invaluable to you, as by that
means you can always be sure that your
oat-meal, hominy, rice, &amp;c., will always
be cooked without burning. Always be
sure that there is water enough in the bottom
kettle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleanliness.</span>—It is very important that
perfect cleanliness be observed in camp,
as it adds much to health and comfort.
When you pitch your tent, select a spot a
little distance from it, for the refuse. Here
dig a deep hole, if your stay is to be long,
and into this hole throw the debris, each
time covering with some of the earth which
you have dug out. By this means you can
keep the place clean and sweet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clothing.</span>—Both ladies and gentlemen
should dress in flannel throughout. One
change of under-flannel is enough extra
clothes to carry, but be sure to take plenty
of stockings. Have your boots well made
and with broad soles. For hats, broad-brimmed
felt hats are the lightest and
coolest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Soap.</span>—Carry plenty of soap for bathing,
for washing dishes, and clothes. Take
three or four pounds of baking soda with
you to use for bathing purposes; and, if
needed, for your mead and cooking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Provisions</span> for camp-life, will depend much
upon the locality, and the requirements of
the party; the following suggestions however,
may be serviceable in making an outfit:—</p>

<p>When it can be obtained take Hecker’s
prepared flour, wheat, rye, Indian, or Graham.
From this you will always be sure of
good bread and griddle-cakes. Salt pork,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
smoked ham, bologna sausage, eggs, dried
beef, salt fish. Game, fresh fish, and fresh
meat are supposed to be obtained in the vicinity
of camp. Pilot bread, crackers.
Canned fruit and vegetables, where fresh
cannot be obtained. Potatoes, beans, onions,
Indian meal, molasses, sugar, salt, pepper,
mustard, vinegar, butter, coffee, tea, chocolate,
rice, oat-meal, baking soda, ginger,
spice, soap, parafine candles, and kerosene
oil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Essential Utensils</span> are tin kettles
with covers, coffee-pot, spiders with covers,
gridiron, pans, basins, tin cups, pails, cans,
knives, forks, spoons, lanterns, bags, ropes,
strings, thread, needles, matches, shovel,
axe, hammer, nails, slicking plaster, Jamaica
ginger, fishing tackle, gun and ammunition,
towels, stockings, and flannel
garments. Each and every one of these
articles may be found serviceable. The
value of a match, a string, knife, a pin, or
a pinch of salt, can never be realized, until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
in the woods or on the water the need of
them has been felt. Parties scorning the
idea of bothering with so many things
when simply going out to <i>rough it</i>, will find
it better to see that every thing is provided
before starting; even then, they will find
camp life rough enough.</p>

<h2>BIRDS.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> camp life, small and large birds
should be either roasted, broiled, or stewed.</p>

<p>Pick all the feathers off, cut a slit in
them, and draw them. Either wash or
wipe carefully. If for roasting, tie the legs
down, and place in the pan. Sprinkle with
flour, cover the bottom of the pan with
water, and roast, if ducks, thirty minutes,
grouse and partridges the same.</p>

<p>Small birds, about half as long. The
oven must be very hot.</p>


<h3>Birds Roasted in their Feathers.</h3>

<p>Open the bird in the usual manner, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
draw it; then cover with wet clay, and
bury in hot coals. In forty minutes, draw
from the coals, and peel off the clay, when
feathers and skin will come also.</p>

<p>A gentleman assures me that they are
perfectly delicious cooked in this manner.</p>


<h3>Broiled Birds.</h3>

<p>Clean, and split down the back. Wipe
dry, and broil over a clear fire, if small, ten
minutes, but, if large, fifteen.</p>

<p>Season with salt, pepper, and butter,
and serve on toast.</p>


<h3>Stewed Partridges or Pigeons.</h3>

<p>Place two partridges in a small kettle,
and dredge with salt, pepper, flour, half
teaspoonful of mace, half of cloves, and
cover with cold water. Cover tight, and
simmer two hours. Thicken with three
spoonfuls of flour, and stir in two spoonfuls
of catsup; simmer one hour longer,
and serve. Grouse and pigeons are stewed
in the same manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>


<h3>Brown Fricassee of Chicken.</h3>

<p>Cut two chickens or old fowl into handsome
pieces, and parboil them in just
water enough to cover them; when they
are tender, take them up, and drain them
dry. Cut a pound of saltpork into slices,
and fry them brown; take up the pork,
dredge the chicken with salt, pepper, and
flour, and fry a dark brown in the pork fat.
When the chicken is all fried, stir into
the remaining pork fat half a cup of dry
flour; stir this until a dark brown, then
pour on it one quart of the liquor in which
the chicken was boiled. (This liquor must
be boiling.) Season with pepper and salt
to taste. Lay the chicken in this gravy,
and simmer twenty minutes. Garnish the
dish with boiled rice.</p>


<h3>White Fricassee of Chicken.</h3>

<p>Boil the chicken until tender, then cut it
into small pieces. With the water in which
it was boiled make a gravy, allowing half a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
cup of flour and two spoonfuls of butter
to every quart of water. Season with
pepper and salt; turn in the chicken, and
let it boil five minutes, and serve. Garnish
the dish with boiled rice.</p>


<h3>Chicken Curry.</h3>

<p>Make the same as white fricassee, with
the addition of one teaspoonful of Indian
curry to one pint of gravy, if it is liked
strong, if not, half a teaspoonful. Dissolve
the curry in a little water, and stir in.
Garnish the dish with rice. Veal and mutton
can be curried in the same manner.</p>


<h3>Chicken Salad.</h3>

<p>Boil tender four good-sized chickens;
when cold, cut off the white meat, and
chop rather coarse. Cut off the white part
of the celery, and chop in the same manner.
To two quarts and a pint of the
chicken, allow one quart and a pint of the
celery and a spoonful of salt. Mix well together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and then stir in part of the dressing.
Shape the salad in a flat dish, and
pour over the remainder of the dressing.
Garnish with hard-boiled eggs, beets, and
the tops of the celery.</p>


<h3>Sauce for Birds.</h3>

<p>Put one tablespoonful of butter into a
pan; and, when it gets hot, add one tablespoonful
of flour; stir until brown, then
add one cup of boiling water, and salt and
pepper to taste.</p>


<h3>Broiled Chicken.</h3>

<p>Split down the back, wash, and wipe dry,
and broil over clear coals twenty-five minutes.
Season with pepper, salt, and butter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>




<h2>FISH.</h2>


<h3>Chowder.</h3>

<p>Take either a cod or haddock; skin it,
loosen the skin about the head, and draw
it down towards the tail, when it will peel
off easily. Then run your knife down the
back close to the bone, which you take out.
Cut your fish in small pieces, and wash in
cold water. Put the head on to boil in about
two quarts of water, and boil twenty minutes.
For a fish weighing six pounds, pare
and slice <i>thin</i> five good-sized potatoes, and
one onion. Place a layer of potatoes and
onion in the pot, then a layer of fish, dredge
in a little salt, pepper, and flour. Keep
putting in alternate layers of potatoes and
fish until all is used. Use about one tablespoonful
of salt, one teaspoonful of pepper,
one teacup of flour in all.</p>

<p>Have ready half a pound of salt pork<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
fried blown. Pour this over the mixture;
add about two quarts of cold water, then
strain on the water in which the head has
been boiled. If this is not water enough
to cover, add more cold. Cover tight, and
boil gently thirty minutes. If not seasoned
enough, add what you please.
When it has boiled twenty minutes, put
in six crackers which have been soaked
three minutes in cold water. If you wish
to add milk and butter, you can do so about
five minutes before taking it up; but for
my taste, it is much nicer and more natural
without either.</p>


<h3>Fish Chowder, No. 2.</h3>

<p>Four pounds of fish, half cod and half
haddock, if you can get the two kinds, two
onions, six potatoes, eight white browns,
one quarter of a pound of salt pork, salt,
pepper. Prepare the chowder as directed
in the preceding rule; split the crackers
and lay on top, pour over the whole hot
water enough to cover, and boil fifteen minutes;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
then wet two tablespoonfuls of flour
with one third of a cup of cream. Stir this
into the boiling chowder, let it boil up once,
and serve. When you cannot get the
white browns, pilot bread will answer.
When a very strong flavor of onion is desired,
use four onions.—<i>Mrs. T. Leighton.</i></p>


<h3>Fried Cod.</h3>

<p>Cut the fish into squares, wash and wipe
dry. Take half a cup of flour, half a cup
of sifted Indian meal, and a tablespoonful
of salt. Mix all these thoroughly. Dip the
fish into the mixture. Have ready a frying-pan
with <i>boiling</i> fat, half lard and half pork
fat; drop in your fish. Fry a dark-brown
on one side, then turn and fry the same on
the other side, but be very careful not to
let the fish or fat burn. Have your dish
hot, and lay your fish on it. Garnish the
sides with the fried pork.</p>


<h3>Broiled Cod, or Scrod.</h3>

<p>Split, wash, and wipe dry a small cod.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Rub the gridiron with a piece of fat pork,
and lay the fish upon it, being careful to
have the inside downward. If the fish is
very thick, cook thirty minutes; but for an
ordinary one, twenty minutes will be sufficient.
Have the dish, in which you intend
serving it, warm; place it upon the fish,
and turn the dish and gridiron over simultaneously.
If the fish sticks to the gridiron,
loosen it gently with a knife. Have
some butter warm, but <i>not melted</i>, with
which to season it. Shake on a little pepper
and salt, and send to the table.</p>


<h3>Baked Cod.</h3>

<p>Scrape and wash clean a cod weighing
four or five pounds. Rub into it a heaping
spoonful of salt. Make a dressing of three
pounded crackers, a little chopped salt-pork
about one teaspoonful of parsley, a little
salt and pepper, and two tablespoonfuls of
cold water. Stuff the belly with this, and
fasten together with a skewer. Lay thin
slices of pork on the fish, which should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
placed on a tin sheet that will fit loosely
into the baking-pan; dredge with flour.
Pour into the pan about half a pint of cold
water. Baste the fish often while cooking,
with the water which is in the pan. If the
water cooks away, add more, but do not
have too much to begin with, or the fish will
be boiled instead of being baked. Bake one
hour. When the fish is cooked, turn the
gravy into a bowl, then lift out the fish
upon the tin sheet (from which you can
easily slide it into the dish upon which
you serve it); now turn your gravy into
your baking-pan again, and place it on the
fire; when it comes to a boil, thicken with
a tablespoonful of flour, season with pepper
and salt.</p>

<p>N. B. Always use a tin sheet in the baking-pan
when cooking fish, as you then can
preserve the shape.</p>


<h3>Broiled Salt Fish.</h3>

<p>Cut a square the size you desire, from the
thickest part of the fish. Take off the skin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and wash clean; broil over clear coals ten
minutes, then dip in boiling water, butter,
and serve. This is a nice relish for breakfast
or tea, and with boiled potatoes makes
an excellent dinner.</p>


<h3>Broiled Mackerel.</h3>

<p>Split down the back, and clean. Be careful
to scrape all the thin black skin from the
inside. Wipe dry, and lay on the gridiron;
broil on one side a nice brown, then turn,
and brown the other side; it will not take
so long to brown the side on which the skin
is. (All fish should have the side on which
the skin is, turned to the fire last, as the
skin burns easily, and coals are not so hot
after you have used them ten minutes.)
Season with butter, pepper, and salt.</p>


<h3>Fried Mackerel.</h3>

<p>Fry brown six good-sized slices of pork.
Prepare your mackerel as for broiling.
Take out your pork, sprinkle a little salt
over the mackerel, then fry a nice brown.
Serve the fried pork with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>


<h3>Baked Mackerel.</h3>

<p>Prepare as for boiling. Make a dressing
as for baked cod. Stuff with this; dredge
with salt and flour. Bake thirty minutes,
basting often with water, butter, and flour.
Make a gravy with the water in the pan in
which the fish is baked. Always make the
gravy quite salt. The best way to cook
mackerel is to <i>broil</i> it.</p>


<h3>Smelts.</h3>

<p>The only true way to cook smelts is to
fry them, although they are sometimes
baked. Open them at the gills. Draw
each smelt separately between your finger
and thumb, beginning at tail; this will press
the insides out. (Some persons never take
out the insides, but it should be done as
much as to any other fish.) Wash them
clean, and let them drain in a cullender;
then salt, and roll in a mixture of half flour
and half Indian meal. Have about two
inches deep of boiling fat in the frying-pan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
(drippings, if you have them; if not, lard);
into this drop the smelts, and fry brown.
Do not put so many in that they will be
crowded; if you do, they will not be crisp
and brown.</p>


<h3>Brook Trout.</h3>

<p>Brook trout are cooked the same as
smelts; or you can cook them as the angler
does. They must be split nearly to the tail
to clean. Wash and drain. For a dozen
good sized trout, fry six slices of salt pork;
when brown, take out the pork, and put in
the trout. Fry a nice brown on all sides.
Serve the pork with them.</p>


<h3>Eels Fried.</h3>

<p>Skin them; then turn on boiling water,
and let them stand in it a few moments;
then cut them into pieces about three inches
long. Fry a nice brown, and serve.</p>


<h3>Baked Eels.</h3>

<p>Prepare as for frying; then put into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
baking-pan, with a little water, flour, pepper,
and salt. Bake twenty minutes. Make
a gravy of the liquor in which they were
baked, adding a little butter.</p>


<h3>Boiled Halibut.</h3>

<p>Pour into a pan about half an inch deep
of boiling water; into this lay the side of
the halibut on which is the black skin; let
this stand a few minutes; then scrape with
a knife, when the black will be found to
peel off readily. Wash clean in cold water,
then pin it in your fish cloth, and drop it
into boiling water. For a piece weighing
four pounds allow twenty-five minutes to
boil. Serve with drawn butter.</p>


<h3>Fried Halibut.</h3>

<p>Take a slice of halibut, sprinkle with salt,
and dredge with flour. Fry four slices of
salt pork, add to the pork fat one spoonful
of lard. When boiling hot put in the halibut.
Fry a light brown on one side, then
turn and fry the same on the other. Serve
the pork with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>


<h3>Broiled Halibut.</h3>

<p>Grease the gridiron with a little butter,
place the halibut upon it, sprinkle a little
salt over it, and place over clear coals.
Cook one side ten minutes, then turn and
cook upon the other side ten more. Have
the dish warm; put the fish upon it, season
with pepper and butter, and send to the
table.</p>


<h3>Smoked Halibut.</h3>

<p>Broiled the same as the fresh, omitting the
pepper and salt. Smoked salmon cooked
in the same way.</p>


<h3>Fried Salmon.</h3>

<p>The same as halibut.</p>


<h3>Broiled Salmon.</h3>

<p>The same as halibut.</p>


<h3>Salmon Trout.</h3>

<p>When large enough, split down the back,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
clean and broil. Season with butter and
salt. When small, open far enough to take
out the insides; wash clean, and wipe dry.
Fry the same as codfish.</p>


<h3>Shad and Haddock.</h3>

<p>Shad and haddock can be cooked the
same as cod.</p>

<h2>SHELL-FISH.</h2>


<h3>Clam-bake.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">For a Party of from ten to twenty Persons.</span>—First,
make an oven of flat stones
placed together in the form of a square, on
a flat surface about two and a half feet
square; around the edge of these, place
other stones to form a bin. Fill this
oven with small kindlings, such as can be
gathered on the beach. On these, pile a
few armfuls of larger sticks, crosswise, so
that the top can be well covered with
stones about the size of one’s two hands.
Start the fire, and allow it to burn down
until the stones, which were on top of the
wood, settle into the oven. Clean out all
the cinders with a poker or stick; for, if allowed
to remain, the smoke from them
will spoil the bake. This must be done
very quickly, that the oven may not cool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Cover the oven with fresh seaweed about
an inch and one-half thick. On the seaweed,
spread the clams so the vegetables,
&amp;c., may be placed on top of them: then,
in order, put on onions, sweet or Irish
potatoes, or both, green corn, then the (blue
or cod) fish, and a live lobster, if one
can be had; if not, a boiled one, which
will be very nice warmed up in this way.</p>

<p>Every thing to be used should be close
at hand, to be put on the oven rapidly
while it is very hot. Cover the whole
bake with a piece of cheap cotton cloth,
to keep out dirt; then cover all with seaweed
until no steam escapes. Bake thirty-five
minutes. Remove the covering from
one corner at a time only,—so that the
rest may keep hot,—and all hands fall to,
and help themselves. It is nice eaten
with drawn butter or vinegar and pepper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Prepare the Fish, Vegetables, &amp;c.</span>—A
party of ten to twenty will require a
bushel of clams, which should be washed
in two or more waters (<i>fresh water;</i> salt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
water will not remove the fine sand); have
ready, in a basket close at hand, as soon
as the oven is hot. Clean the fish nicely,
split the backs, season with salt and white
pepper, and wrap in clean cloth. Peel
onions, wash the potatoes clean, and cut
the ends off; husk the corn, leaving the
inner layer on to keep it clean.</p>


<h3>Clam Chowder.</h3>

<p>When intending to have clams in any
form, get them in the shell if possible, the
day before. Place them in a tub, and cover
with clean water, and throw into this about
a quart of Indian meal. This fattens them.
When ready to use the clams, wash them
thoroughly, then cover them with <i>boiling</i>
water, and let them stand ten minutes, when
they will open easily. Take them from the
shell, cut off the black heads, and put the
bodies of the clams in a clean dish. Strain
the water in which they were scalded into
the kettle in which you intend to cook your
chowder. To one peck of clams allow three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
quarts of water. Let the water come to a
boil, then thicken with half a cup flour
which has been mixed with cold water,
season with pepper and salt. Add the
clams and a tablespoonful of butter; let
it boil ten minutes. A few minutes before
dishing, drop in three or four broken crackers.</p>


<h3>Clam Chowder, No. 2.</h3>

<p>For one peck of clams take six good-sized
potatoes, pared and sliced thin, half an onion
cut into pieces an inch square. Fry quarter
of a pound of pork to a nice brown;
place the pork and gravy, the potatoes and
onions, in your kettle. Shake over the
whole one tablespoonful of salt, two teaspoonfuls
of pepper, and half a cup of flour.
Strain over this four quarts of the water
with which you scalded the clams. Place
on the fire, and boil fifteen minutes, then add
the clams and four split crackers; boil ten
minutes longer, and serve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>


<h3>Clam Boil.</h3>

<p>Fill the pot with clams (which have been
washed in a number of waters to remove
all the sand); add hot water enough to get
up a good steam, and boil until the shells
begin to open; then serve.</p>


<h3>Clam Fritters.</h3>

<p>One egg, one pint of prepared flour,
three-fourths of a pint of milk. Beat egg
light. Stir milk into flour, then egg. Cut
black heads from clams, mix with both, and
fry in hot fat.</p>


<h3>Scalloped Oysters.</h3>

<p>Put a layer of oysters in an oval dish,
and dredge in a little salt, pepper, and butter;
then a layer of rolled cracker, and
another of oysters; dredge the oysters as
before, and cover with cracker; over the
cracker grate a little nutmeg, and lay on
small pieces of butter. Bake twenty minutes
in a quick oven; add a glass of Madeira<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
wine if you choose. Allow four
crackers, two spoonfuls of butter, and one
teaspoonful of pepper to one quart of oysters.
Fill the dish to within an inch of the
top.</p>


<h3>Fried Oysters.</h3>

<p>Drain the oysters on a sieve; roll them
in cracker crumbs, and fry in <i>boiling</i> lard
a light brown. Serve on brown-bread toast.
When you desire them fried in batter, make
one as for apple fritters, and fry in boiling
lard. Have the dishes very hot.</p>


<h3>Broiled Oysters.</h3>

<p>Prepare in crumbs as for frying, and
broil a light brown. Examine oysters carefully
to see that there are not pieces of
shell among them. Some oysters need more
salt than others.</p>


<h3>Oyster Stew.</h3>

<p>Drain all the liquor from the oysters;
put it into a porcelain kettle, and let it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
come to a boil; then skim off all the scum.
Now turn in the milk, which you have let
come to a boil in hot water. (Allow one
quart of milk to one pint of oysters.) Stir
in also one spoonful of butter or more, salt
and pepper to taste. Now put in the oysters,
let them boil up once, and serve with
a dish of oyster crackers.</p>


<h3>Oyster Soup.</h3>

<p>Wash one quart of oysters, if they are
solid, in one quart of cold water; if not,
one pint of water; drain the water through
a cullender into the soup-kettle; set the
kettle on the fire, and when the liquor comes
to a boil, skim it; then add one quart of
rich new milk; just before it comes to a
boil, turn in the oysters, and thicken with
two spoonfuls of cornstarch wet with milk;
then stir in half a cup of butter, and season
with pepper and salt. Let this boil up
once, and serve immediately. Be very
careful that they do not burn. A safe
way is to boil the milk in a basin, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
is set into another of water, and then turn
it on the oysters just before removing it
from the fire.</p>


<h3>Broiled Lobster.</h3>

<p>Drop the live lobster into <i>boiling</i> water,
and boil three minutes. Take up, drain,
and crack the shell, but do not take out
the meat. Lay on the gridiron, and boil
slowly half an hour.</p>

<p>Serve in the shell.</p>


<h3>To Boil Lobster.</h3>

<p>Be sure that the lobster is living; if not,
it is not fit for use. Have a kettle of <i>boiling</i>
water; into this drop the lobster, and
boil until the shell turns red. This takes
about a half-hour. Take up; and when
cold it is fit to eat.</p>


<h3>Stewed Lobster.</h3>

<p>Take out all the meat from the shell.
Chop it, but not fine. Put into a basin with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
a little salt, pepper, butter, and half a cup
of water to a small lobster. Stew about ten
minutes.</p>


<h3>Curried Lobster.</h3>

<p>Prepare the lobster as for stew; when it
comes to a boil, add a mixture of a heaping
tablespoonful of flour, and half a teaspoonful
of Indian curry mixed with cold water.
Let this boil eight minutes, then serve.</p>


<h3>Lobster Salad.</h3>

<p>Lobster salad is made the same as
chicken, using lobster instead of chicken,
and lettuce instead of celery.</p>

<h2>EGGS.</h2>


<h3>Poached Eggs.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Break</span> and beat up two eggs, and stir into
them two tablespoonfuls of milk and half
a teaspoonful of salt; put them into a
basin, with half a spoonful of butter, and
set over the fire. Stir until it thickens,
and then serve.</p>


<h3>Scrambled Eggs.</h3>

<p>Beat together four eggs, and then turn into
a pan with one spoonful of melted butter.
Stir quickly over a hot fire one minute, and
serve.</p>


<h3>Omelets.</h3>

<p>Beat lightly two eggs, and stir in one
spoonful of milk and a pinch of salt. Heat
the omelet pan hot, and then put in a little
bit of butter, and when melted turn in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
beaten eggs; set on the fire, shake the pan,
cook until a light brown; then fold the
omelet and serve on a hot dish. Ham,
mushroom, lobster, chicken, and all kinds
of omelets are made by chopping up the
meat, and laying it between the folds before
dishing.</p>

<h2>MEATS.</h2>


<h3>Fried Salt Pork.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cut</span> salt pork into slices a quarter of an
inch thick, cut off the rind, and then pour
over them boiling water, in which let them
stand ten minutes; then turn off the
water, and fry until they are brown on both
sides.</p>


<h3>Broiled Salt Pork.</h3>

<p>Prepare as for fried, and broil ten minutes
over clear coals.</p>


<h3>Salt Pork Fried in Batter.</h3>

<p>Fry the pork as before directed; dip in
batter, and fry in the pork fat, to which
should be added two spoonfuls of drippings
or lard. Make the batter in the following
manner: Mix gradually with one cup of
flour one cup of milk, and then add one
well beaten egg and a little salt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>


<h3>Fried Ham.</h3>

<p>Cut the ham in very thin slices, and cut
off the rind. Have half a spoonful of boiling
drippings in the frying-pan, lay the ham
in this, and fry quickly eight minutes; it
will then be brown and crisp. Where the
ham is for dinner, have the slices larger
and thicker, and if you do not have eggs
with it, fry bread, as directed for sausages.</p>


<h3>Broiled Ham.</h3>

<p>Cut the ham in thin slices; cut off the
rind, and broil over clear coals ten minutes.
Butter or not, as you please. When
the ham is very salt or hard, slice, and let
stand in boiling water ten minutes before
frying or broiling.</p>


<h3>Ham and Eggs.</h3>

<p>Fry the ham as before directed, and when
the ham is all fried, turn the fat into a
basin, and scrape the salt from the frying-pan;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
turn back the fat, and add to it half a
cup of lard. When this comes to a boil,
break in your eggs, leaving room to turn
them, if you prefer them turned; they look
much nicer, however, when they are not
turned. If they are not turned, dip up the
boiling fat while they are cooking and pour
over them; they will cook rare in two minutes,
well done in three. Lay them on the
slices of ham, and serve.</p>


<h3>Breakfast Bacon.</h3>

<p>Cooked the same as ham.</p>


<h3>Beefsteak Smothered in Onions.</h3>

<p>Fry brown four slices of salt pork; when
brown take out the pork, and put in six
onions sliced thin. Fry about ten minutes,
stirring all the while; then take out all except
a thin layer, and upon this lay a slice
of steak, then a layer of onions, then steak,
and cover thick with onions. Dredge each
layer with pepper, salt and flour. Pour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
over this one cupful of boiling water, and
cover tight. Simmer half an hour. When
you dish, place the steak in the centre of
the dish, and heap the onions around it.
Serve the same vegetables as for broiled
steak.</p>


<h3>Broiled Beef Steak.</h3>

<p>Cut the steak about three quarters of an
inch thick. Have a clear fire and lay the
steak on the gridiron, and dredge lightly
with flour. If you desire the steak rare,
cook ten minutes, if well done, fifteen.
Dish and season with butter, pepper, and
salt. Serve <i>immediately</i>. Never set steak
into the oven to keep warm or to melt the
butter. The dish must be hot, the butter
stand in a warm room long enough to soften,
but do not <i>melt</i>. If for dinner, serve potatoes,
either baked or boiled, and any other
vegetables which you choose. Many persons
pound tough steak before cooking, but
I would not recommend it, as by this means
it loses much of its juiciness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>There are some families in the country
who have no means of broiling. The next
best thing such persons can do is to heat
the frying pan very hot, and grease with
just enough butter to prevent the steak
from sticking; then lay the steak in, and
cook, and serve as before directed.</p>


<h3>Fried Beefsteak.</h3>

<p>For two pounds of steak fry brown four
slices of salt pork, then take up the pork
and fry the steak in the fat; salt and pepper
it. When you dish, add a little butter.
To the fat remaining in the frying-pan, after
the steak has been cooked, add one tablespoonful
of <i>dry</i> flour (be sure to have the
fat boiling), and stir until it is brown and
there are no lumps, then pour in about half
a cup of boiling water. Season well with
pepper and salt. Serve in a gravy tureen.
This is a more economical, but not so
healthy a method as broiling.</p>


<h3>Stewed Beef.</h3>

<p>Take a piece of beef that is rather tough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
or pieces of tough beefsteak; rub into it a
handful of salt, some pepper and flour; lay
in a kettle that you can cover tight, and
that has a flat bottom. Cut up an onion,
a potato, a <i>small</i> turnip, a carrot, and a
parsnip; lay these on top of the meat, and
then sprinkle in half a teaspoonful of cinnamon,
half of mace, one-fourth of clove,
and add cold water enough to cover it. Let
them come to a boil, skim off all the scum;
then cover tight, and simmer five hours.
After it has been boiling four hours, mix
half a cup of flour with cold water and add
to it. You can then taste it, and add more
seasoning if necessary. The spice may be
omitted if you choose.</p>


<h3>Lamb Chops.</h3>

<p>Broil fifteen minutes over clear coals.
Season with butter, pepper, and salt.</p>


<h3>Broiled Veal.</h3>

<p>Cut veal into thin slices, and broil twenty
minutes. Season with butter, pepper, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
salt. This is the most unsavory method
of cooking veal, and I would not recommend
it.</p>


<h3>Fricassee of Veal.</h3>

<p>Fry eight slices of salt pork, brown.
Take out the pork, and put in <i>thin</i> slices of
veal, which have been cut from the leg.
Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and fry
<i>brown</i>. When all the veal is fried, mix
with the boiling fat two tablespoonfuls of
<i>dry</i> flour; stir until there are no lumps,
and the flour is brown; then add two cups
of boiling water, and season with salt and
pepper. Lay the veal in this gravy, and
simmer fifteen minutes. Dish, and pour
the gravy over the meat. If for dinner,
garnish with boiled rice, and serve plain
boiled potatoes.</p>


<h3>Mutton Chops.</h3>

<p>Cut the chops from the loin or the neck;
broil as you do beefsteak, and serve in <i>hot</i>
dishes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>


<h3>Mutton Pie with Tomatoes.</h3>

<p>Pare and slice six tomatoes; put a layer
into a deep pudding-dish, then put in a layer
of slices of cold mutton, and dredge in flour,
salt, pepper. Have the last layer tomatoes,
over which sprinkle two rolled crackers.
Bake one hour.</p>


<h3>Veal Cutlets.</h3>

<p>Fry brown eight slices of salt pork.
Take them up, and add to the fat two large
spoonfuls of lard or drippings. Have ready
thin slices of veal (they are best cut from
the leg), dip them in an egg which has been
well beaten, then into cracker crumbs, and
fry a nice brown. Season them, before dipping
in the egg and cracker, with pepper
and salt. Serve with the salt pork.</p>


<h3>Mutton Cutlets.</h3>

<p>The same as veal.</p>


<h3>Fried Sausages.</h3>

<p>Cut the sausages apart, and wash; then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
lay them in the pan, and pour boiling water
over them; let them boil two minutes,
then turn off the water, and prick the sausages
with a fork, or they will burst open
when they begin to fry. Put a little drippings
in the pan with them, and fry twenty
minutes. Turn them often that they may
be brown on all sides. Cut stale bread into
fanciful shape, fry in the sausage fat, and
garnish the dish with it. Brown bread is
delicious fried in this way. Serve plain
boiled potatoes.</p>

<h2>VEGETABLES.</h2>


<h3>Boiled Potatoes.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> the potatoes are new, wash clean, and
put into boiling water; boil thirty minutes,
and serve immediately. As they grow
older, scrape the skin off before boiling.
For old potatoes, have a sharp knife with a
<i>thin</i> blade; and pare the potatoes, having
the skin as thin as possible. They are very
much better if they stand in cold water a
few hours before boiling; then put them in
boiling water, and boil thirty minutes.
When they have boiled fifteen minutes,
throw in a handful of salt. When done,
turn off the water, and let them stand on
the back part of the range three minutes;
then, shake them up once, and turn into the
dish, and send to the table.</p>


<h3>Baked Potatoes.</h3>

<p>Be very particular to wash every part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the potato clean, as many persons eat the
skin. Put them in a pan (have an old one
for this purpose), and bake in a moderate
oven fifty minutes. There is such a difference
in ovens, that each one must learn for
herself what the time will be for each; for
some will bake in less time, and some will
take much longer than the time designated.</p>


<h3>Fried Potatoes.</h3>

<p>Pare and slice <i>thin</i> raw potatoes, and let
them stand in cold water several hours; if
in summer, put a piece of ice in the water.
Cut the slices <i>lengthwise</i> of the potato.
Have ready a basin with <i>boiling</i> drippings
or lard, drain the potatoes a minute in a
cullender, and drop them into the boiling
fat, and fry a light brown; take them out
with a skimmer, and lay them in a dry cullender,
which should be placed in a tin pan,
and set in an open oven. There should be
as much fat as for frying doughnuts, and
there should not be any more potatoes put
in at a time than will fry brown and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
stick together. Have the basin in which
you fry quite deep, as there is danger of the
fat boiling over when the potatoes are put
in. When you take the potatoes up, dredge
a little salt over them. When potatoes are
cooked in this manner, they will be light
and crisp. If they do not get cooked enough
at first, they are very much improved by
dropping them into the fat for one minute,
after they have been standing in the oven
a while.</p>


<h3>Fried Boiled Potatoes.</h3>

<p>Cut the potatoes into slices, and fry in
either pork fat or nice drippings. Have
just fat enough in the pan to prevent their
sticking, and sprinkle with salt while cooking.
When these are brown, take them up
and put in a little more fat, and fry as before.</p>


<h3>Potatoes warmed with Pork.</h3>

<p>Cut about eight slices of pork into pieces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
about half an inch square, and fry a nice
brown. Have ready one dozen cold potatoes
cut into slices, and turn them into the
pan with the fried pork, and dredge in a little
salt and pepper, then stir and cut them
into small pieces with the knife. When
a light brown, serve.</p>


<h3>Potatoes warmed in Gravy.</h3>

<p>Slice cold potatoes as for frying, and turn
them into the frying-pan, and to a dozen
potatoes add a pint of cold gravy. Season
with pepper and salt, and stir, and cut
with a knife, until they are hot and in small
pieces.</p>


<h3>Fricassee of Potatoes.</h3>

<p>Cut cold boiled potatoes into small
squares, and put them in a basin with milk,
pepper, and salt, allowing half a pint of
milk to a dozen potatoes. Set the basin
into another of hot water, and when it comes
to a boil, add a tablespoonful of butter, and
set on the stove, and let it boil up once,
then serve.</p>

<h3>Boiled Sweet Potatoes.</h3>

<p>Wash and boil, with the skins on, forty-five
minutes. They are much better baked
than boiled, and I would cook them so generally.</p>


<h3>Baked Sweet Potatoes.</h3>

<p>Wash and wipe dry, and bake one hour.
Do not cook squash when you have sweet
potatoes.</p>


<h3>Boiled Onions.</h3>

<p>When new and tender, they will boil in
one hour; but after the month of October,
they will require two hours. Put them into
water before peeling them, and they will
not affect the eyes. Peel off all the dark
skin, and put them in hot water, and boil
as directed. If you have milk plenty, half
an hour before they are done, turn a quart
into the water in which they are boiling.
This makes them white, and is said to prevent
in a measure, the disagreeable odor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
which always follows their being eaten.
Boil them in a porcelain kettle. Dish them
whole, and season with a little pepper, salt,
and butter.</p>


<h3>Fried Onions.</h3>

<p>Peel and slice thin ten good-sized onions,
and put them in a frying-pan with two
spoonfuls of drippings. Fry thirty minutes,
turning often.</p>


<h3>Baked Squash.</h3>

<p>Cut the squash in two, take out all the
soft, stringy part; if you need the whole
squash for dinner, lay the halves together,
and put in a baking-pan (the old one you
use for baking potatoes in), and bake forty-five
minutes. When done, scrape the squash
from the shell, and season, and serve as
boiled squash. When you cook but half a
squash, lay it with the inside downward.
This is a nice way to cook watery squash.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>


<h3>Beets.</h3>

<p>Wash clean, but do not scrape; if you
do they will look white when cooked.
When young they will cook in two hours;
but old ones will require four or five hours.
When done, plunge them into cold water,
and the skin will peel off easily. Cut in
thin slices.</p>


<h3>Pickled Beets.</h3>

<p>Cut the beets that are left from dinner
into thin slices, and lay them in an earthen
vessel, and cover with cold vinegar.</p>


<h3>Shelled Beans.</h3>

<p>Wash in several waters, and put them in
a basin with boiling water. Boil one hour.
Do not drain them very dry. Season with
butter and salt.</p>


<h3>Boston Baked Beans.</h3>

<p>Examine and wash one quart of dry
beans (the pea bean is the best), and put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
them in a pan with six quarts of cold water;
let them soak in this over night. In
the morning wash them in another water,
and place them on the fire with six quarts
of cold water and a pound of mixed salt
pork. If they are the present year’s beans,
they will cook enough in half an hour; if
older, one hour. Drain them and put half
in the bean-pot; then gash the pork, and
put in the remainder of the beans, one tablespoonful
of molasses, and one of salt, and
cover with boiling water. Bake ten hours.
Watch them carefully, and do not let them
cook dry.</p>

<p>N. B. As the water cooks away, add
more.</p>


<h3>String Beans.</h3>

<p>String and cut into pieces about an inch
long; then wash and put into boiling water,
and boil one hour. Season with salt
and butter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>


<h3>Green Peas.</h3>

<p>Put them into boiling water, and when
very young they will cook in twenty minutes;
but generally they require thirty.
Season with salt and butter.</p>


<h3>Boiled Rice.</h3>

<p>Wash and pick all the specks from a cup
of rice. Let it stand in cold water two
hours, and then put it in a deep kettle, with
two quarts of water, and boil <i>fast</i> thirty
minutes. When it has boiled twenty minutes,
throw in a great spoonful of salt.
When done, turn into a cullender, and set
in the oven a few minutes. When ready to
dish, shake lightly and <i>turn</i> into the vegetable
dish. Never use a spoon. If these
directions are followed, you will have a
handsome and healthy vegetable, and every
kernel will be separate. The water in
which the rice has been boiled makes a nice
starch for colored clothes.</p>

<p>The Southern rice cooks much quicker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and is nicer than the Indian rice. If possible,
always purchase the former.</p>


<h3>Boiled Rice, No. 2.</h3>

<p>Wash one cupful of rice and put into a tin
basin or pail, with three cupfuls of cold water,
and a teaspoonful of salt, cover and set in
another basin, with hot water, place on the
fire, and boil thirty minutes. Rice is very
healthy, and should be a common dish on
the table.</p>


<h3>Boiled Macaroni.</h3>

<p>Break up and wash a pint bowl full of
macaroni, and put in a shallow basin, and
cover with cold water. Set this basin into
another of warm water, and place on the
fire; after fifteen minutes, add a pint of
milk, and a teaspoonful of salt; let it cook
ten minutes longer, then add a spoonful of
butter, and cook five minutes more, and
dish. Be careful not to break the macaroni
in dishing. The boiled macaroni which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
remains from one dinner can be used for
the next, by preparing it in the following
manner: Butter a shallow dish, and turn
the macaroni into it; then grate over it old
cheese, and brown.</p>


<h3>Boiled Green Corn.</h3>

<p>Boil twenty-five minutes, if very young
and tender. As it grows older it requires
a longer time. Send to the table in a napkin.</p>


<h3>Boiled Turnips.</h3>

<p>Peel and cut into slices. If they are to
be served in slices, boil with a small piece
of pork. Boil the pork three hours, and
put in the turnips; if they are the white
turnip, they will cook in forty-five minutes;
but if the yellow, they will require two
hours. Serve in slices without any seasoning
except what they get by being boiled
with the pork.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>


<h3>Stewed Tomatoes.</h3>

<p>Pour boiling water over half a peck of
ripe tomatoes. Let them stand in it five
minutes, and then peel off the skins; cut
them into slices, and put in a stew-pan with
a little salt, pepper, and a spoonful of sugar.
Simmer two hours, stirring often to prevent
burning. Two minutes before dishing stir
in one tablespoonful of butter. Canned tomatoes
are cooked in the same manner, but
do not require more than half an hour to
stew.</p>


<h3>Sliced Tomatoes.</h3>

<p>Pour boiling water over them, and then
peel and slice thin; lay them on small platters,
and serve. Let each person season to
his own taste.</p>


<h3>Baked Tomatoes.</h3>

<p>Scald and peel as directed; have ready a
dish, into which lay a layer of tomatoes
(whole), then sprinkle with salt, pepper,
and cracker crumbs; then another layer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
of tomatoes, and sprinkle again with salt
and pepper. Cut a spoonful of butter into
small pieces and lay on the tomatoes, and
then cover with cracker crumbs. Bake
thirty minutes.</p>


<h3>Mock Bisque Soup.—Very nice.</h3>

<p>Stew one can of tomatoes (one quart
can). While the tomatoes are stewing, put
three pints of milk on to boil, setting the
basin in which the milk is into another
of hot water. When the milk comes to a
boil, stir in a tablespoonful of flour, which
has been thoroughly mixed with a little
cold milk. Let this boil ten minutes, and
then add butter the size of an egg, salt and
pepper to taste. The tomatoes, which
were put on at the same time with the milk,
are now ready to strain into the mixture.
Just before straining, stir a pinch of saleratus
into the tomatoes to remove the
acidity. Serve immediately.</p>

<h2>BREAD.</h2>


<h3>Corn Dodgers.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Take</span> three teacups of Indian meal, one
teaspoonful of salt, one tablespoonful of
sugar, and pour on boiling water enough
to wet it, nearly one quart; then make into
small, flat cakes about an inch thick, and
fry in <i>boiling</i> fat until brown. They will
fry in fifteen or twenty minutes. To be
eaten <i>very hot</i>.</p>


<h3>Baked Corn Cake.</h3>

<p>Three teacups of Indian meal, one teaspoonful
of salt, one tablespoonful of sugar,
one of butter; wet this with <i>boiling</i> water,
and then beat in one egg. Spread half an
inch deep on buttered tin sheets, and bake
brown in a quick oven. This is delicious.</p>


<h3>Oat-meal.</h3>

<p>Oatmeal, Indian meal, and hominy all require<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
two things to make them perfect;
that is, <i>plenty of water</i> when first put on to
boil, and a <i>long</i> time to boil.</p>

<p>Have about two quarts of boiling water
in a large stewpan, and into it stir one cup
of oatmeal, which you have already wet
with cold water; boil this an hour, stirring
often, and then add half a spoonful of salt,
and boil an hour longer. If it should get
too stiff, add more boiling water; or, if too
thin, boil a little longer. You cannot boil
it too much.</p>

<p>The only trouble there is in cooking oatmeal
is, that it takes a long time; and surely
no one will let that stand in the way when
it is so much better for having the extra
time. It is also very necessary that there
be an abundance of water to begin with;
if not, it will never be as good, no matter
how much may be added after it has been
cooking any time.</p>


<h3>Hominy.</h3>

<p>Wash in two waters one cup of hominy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
then stir it into one quart of boiling water
with a little salt, and boil from thirty to
sixty minutes. It is better boiled sixty
than thirty. Be careful that it does not
burn. Hominy can be used more than oatmeal,
as it can be eaten with any kind of
meat, and should be cooked once a day. It
is nice and appropriate for any meal. It is
also good eaten warm or cold with milk.</p>


<h3>Hominy Griddle-cakes.</h3>

<p>To one pint of warm, boiled hominy, add
a pint of milk or water, and one pint of
flour. Beat up two or three eggs, and stir
them into the batter with a little salt. Fry
as any other griddle-cake. They are delicious.</p>


<h3>Fried Mush.</h3>

<p>Into two quarts of boiling water stir one
tablespoonful of salt, and one cup of flour
mixed with one quart of Indian meal (it
may take a little more than a quart of meal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
to make it stiff enough); beat it well, or it
will be lumpy. Boil gently two hours, and
then turn into dishes which have been
dipped in cold water, and set away to cool.
Pans in which you bake loaves of bread are
the best to cool it in, as it then makes handsome
slices. In the morning cut into slices
an inch thick, and fry brown in pork fat.
Serve slices of fried pork with it. You can
cook enough at one time for several breakfasts.
If you do not wish to fry the mush,
do not use the flour, and do not make quite
so stiff.</p>


<h3>Spider-Cakes.</h3>

<p>Heat the frypan hot; also a cover for it.
While heating, mix with one pint of Hecker’s
prepared flour half a pint of milk or
water; grease the hot pan with pork, lard,
or butter, and pour half the mixture into
it. Make smooth with the spoon; cover,
and cook four minutes; turn the cake, and
cook four minutes longer. Take up, grease
the pan again, and put in the remainder
of the mixture, which cook as before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>


<h3>Biscuit.</h3>

<p>One quart of Hecker’s prepared flour,
one small pint of milk or water. Grease
the pans, and drop the mixture by the
spoonful on to it; bake in a quick oven
from ten to twelve minutes.</p>

<p>N. B. If you prefer, shape into cakes
with the hands.</p>


<h3>Hecker’s Prepared Graham.</h3>

<p>Rye and Indian are nice to take into
camp, as all that is necessary is to wet
with milk or water, and bake. The buckwheat
is nice also.</p>

<p>When you have Hecker’s prepared Graham,
rye, or Indian, use one half a cup of
sugar to the quart of the preparation.</p>


<h3>Milk Toast.</h3>

<p>Put one quart of milk in a tin pail or basin,
and set into a kettle of boiling water.
When it comes to a boil, stir in two spoonfuls
of flour, mixed with half a cup of milk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
one spoonful of butter, and salt to taste;
let this boil ten minutes, and then put in
the bread, which must be toasted brown.
Cook five minutes longer, and serve.</p>

<h2>PUDDINGS.</h2>


<h3>Boiled Rice.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Pick</span> and wash clean one cupful of rice,
and put into a basin with a pint and a half
of cold water; set on the stove where it
will cook slowly; or, better still, set into
another basin of water, and cook slowly.
When the rice has absorbed all the water,
turn on it one quart of new milk, and stir
in one tablespoonful of salt; let this cook
two hours, stirring often. Serve with sugar
and cream.</p>


<h3>Baked Rice.</h3>

<p>Pick and wash one cup of rice; put it in
a dish that will hold two quarts and a pint,
and cover with fresh milk; stir into this
two teaspoonfuls of salt, one tablespoonful
of cinnamon, and four of sugar. Set this
in the oven, and stir once in every half-hour;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
after it has been baking two hours stir in
milk enough to fill the dish, and bake one
hour longer (the dish should be nearly full
of milk at first). Serve with sugar and
milk.</p>


<h3>Minute Pudding.</h3>

<p>One pint of milk, one of water, nine
tablespoonfuls of flour, one teaspoonful of
salt, two eggs. Set the milk into a basin
of hot water, and when it comes to a boil
add to it one pint of boiling water. Have
ready the flour, made into a smooth paste
with one cup of milk, and mix with this
paste, after they are well beaten, the two
eggs; now take the basin in which the
milk and water are, and set upon the fire;
let it boil up once, and then stir in the
thickening; beat it well, that it may be
smooth, and cook three minutes longer.
Serve with vinegar sauce.</p>


<h3>Apple Dowdy.</h3>

<p>Pare and quarter about one dozen good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
tart apples, put them in a kettle with one
cup of molasses, a small piece of butter,
and one pint of hot water. Set this on the
fire, and let it come to a boil, and while it
is heating make a paste with one pint of
prepared flour and one half a pint of milk.
Roll this out large enough to cover the apple,
put it into the kettle, cover tight, and
boil gently twenty minutes.</p>


<h3>Down East Pudding.</h3>

<p>One pint of molasses, one quart of flour,
one tablespoonful of salt, one teaspoonful
of soda, three pints of blackberries. Boil
three hours, and serve with sauce made in
the following manner:—</p>

<p>One teacup of powdered sugar, one-half
of butter, one egg, two teaspoonfuls of
<i>boiling</i> water, and one of brandy. Beat
the butter to a cream, and then add very
gradually the sugar beat in the yolk of an
egg, and, when perfectly creamy, add the
white, which has been beaten to a froth,
then add the water and stir it very carefully.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
The brandy should be beaten with
the butter and sugar.</p>


<h3>Bread Pudding.</h3>

<p>Take a quart basinful of stale bread, and
soak in two quarts of sweet milk two hours
(keep in a cool place while soaking); then
mash well with a spoon, and take out all
the hard pieces. Beat light four eggs and
stir into this, then add two teaspoonfuls of
salt, a little nutmeg, and one fourth of a
cup of sugar, if you serve it with sauce;
if not, one and a half cupfuls. Bake three-quarters
of an hour, and serve with lemon
sauce. Some put raisins in, but it must be
much stiffer if you have them, and the delicacy
of the pudding is thereby lost.</p>


<h3>Corn Starch Pudding.</h3>

<p>One quart of milk, six tablespoonfuls of
cornstarch, three eggs, one teaspoonful of
salt. Put the milk in a basin, and set the
basin into a kettle with boiling water, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
when it comes to a boil stir in the cornstarch
and eggs, which prepare in the following
manner: Wet the cornstarch with
one cup of cold milk, and then stir into it
the eggs which are well beaten. After the
starch is added to the boiling milk it will
cook in three minutes: beat well to make
smooth. Serve with sugar and cream or
wine sauce. Never add the eggs after the
starch has been stirred into the boiling
milk; if you do the egg will be in spots in
it.</p>

<h2>CAKE.</h2>


<h3>Tea Cake.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> spoonful of butter, one cup of sugar,
one of milk, one pint of prepared flour.
Beat the sugar and butter together, and
then the two eggs; next stir the milk with
them, and then stir in the flour. Turn it,
about an inch deep, into shallow pans, and
bake in a quick oven. To be eaten warm.</p>


<h3>Berry Cake.</h3>

<p>Make the same as tea-cake, only pint and
a half of flour, and stir in one pint of blueberries.</p>


<h3>Plain Cup Cake.</h3>

<p>Half a cup of butter, one of sugar, three
of prepared flour, one of milk, three eggs,
and lemon or nutmeg to taste. Beat the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
butter light, then add the sugar gradually,
beating all the time until it is a cream, and
then add the eggs, which have been beaten
light, and the milk; mix all these well together,
and then stir in the flour. Flavor
and bake either in loaves or sheets; when
done, the place on top where it has cracked
open will look well done. If baked in
loaves, it will take forty minutes; in sheets,
twenty. This quantity will make two small
loaves.</p>


<h3>Soft Molasses Gingerbread, No. 2.</h3>

<p>One cup of molasses, one teaspoonful of
saleratus, one of ginger, one tablespoonful
of butter or lard, a pinch of salt, if you
use lard. Stir this together, and then pour
on half a cup of <i>boiling</i> water, and one pint
of flour. Bake about one inch deep in a
sheet. This is very nice if pains are taken
to have the water boiling, and to beat it
well when the flour is added.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Sauces and Dressings.</span></h2>


<h3>Drawn Butter.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Beat</span> one cup of butter and two spoonfuls
of flour to a cream, and pour over this one
pint of boiling water. Set on the fire, and
let it come to a boil, but do <i>not boil</i>. Serve
immediately.</p>


<h3>Egg Sauce.</h3>

<p>Chop up two hard-boiled eggs, and stir
into drawn butter.</p>


<h3>Oyster Sauce.</h3>

<p>Set a basin on the fire with half a pint
of oysters and one pint of boiling water;
let them boil three minutes, and then stir
in half a cup of butter beaten to a cream,
with two spoonfuls of flour; let this come
to a boil, and serve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>


<h3>Salad Dressing.</h3>

<p>One tablespoonful of mustard, one-half
of sugar, one teaspoonful of salt, one-fourth
of cayenne pepper, and the yolks of three
uncooked eggs. Put this mixture in an
earthen dish and set on ice; stir with a
wooden or silver spoon until it is all well
mixed, then add, very gradually, one bottle
of table oil. Stir until very light; then
stir in half a cup of vinegar. Be sure that
you stir evenly, and one way all the time.
This is enough for four quarts of salad.</p>

<p>N. B. You can use six yolks of eggs,
and one-half or even one-fourth of a bottle
of oil.</p>


<h3>Boiled Salad Dressing.</h3>

<p>Three eggs, one tablespoonful of sugar,
one of oil, one each of mustard and salt,
scant one cup of vinegar, one cup of milk.
Beat the eggs, and add the other ingredients,
then stir all together over a basin of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
boiling water until about as thick as soft
custard. Cool and bottle.</p>

<p>Gentlemen will find this easily made and
convenient, as it will keep one or two weeks
if kept in a cool place. It takes from twelve
to fifteen minutes to cook.</p>


<h3>Caper Sauce.</h3>

<p>Into a pint of drawn butter stir three
spoonfuls of capers.</p>

and stirred into it.</p>


<h3>Brown Sauce.</h3>

<p>Three tablespoonfuls of pork fat, two of
flour, one pint of boiling water, salt and
pepper to taste. When the fat is hot, stir
in the dry flour, and cook until brown, then
stir in gradually the boiling water. Season
to taste, and cook five minutes. This sauce
can be varied by adding any kind of catsup.</p>


<h3>Dried Apple Sauce.</h3>

<p>Pick and wash the apples carefully, then
place in a tin pail with a cover. For one
pint of dried apple, cut the thin yellow skin
off a lemon, and then pare and cut up the
inside. Put the yellow skin (be careful
not to get any of the white) and the inside
into the kettle with the apple, and three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
pints of cold water. Cover tight, and simmer
three hours, then put in one pint of
sugar, but do not stir the apple, and simmer
two hours longer. <i>Never stir</i> dried
apple-sauce.</p>

Mocha gives you a very fine flavor. When
buying, have them mix it in the store.</p>


<h3>Shells.</h3>

<p>Put one quart of cold water and half a
cup of shells into the pot, and boil gently
four or five hours; add boiling water occasionally.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
About twenty minutes before
serving, add one pint of new milk and boiling
water enough to make three pints in
all. Let this boil a few minutes, strain and
serve.</p>


<h3>Chocolate.</h3>

<p>With four spoonfuls of grated chocolate,
mix one of sugar, and wet with one of <i>boiling</i>
water. Rub this smooth with the bowl
of the spoon, and then stir into one pint of
boiling water; let this boil up once, and
then add one pint of good milk; let this
boil up once, and serve.</p>


<h3>Prepared Cocoa.</h3>

<p>Prepared cocoa is made the same as chocolate,
omitting the sugar. All milk may be
used if preferred. Never boil chocolate or
prepared cocoa more than one minute.
Boiling makes it oily. The quicker it is
used after making the better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>


<h3>Coffee, No</h3>

<p>Half a cup of dry coffee, one egg, shell
and all. Mix coffee and egg together, then
pour on one quart of boiling water. Boil
ten minutes, and then add half a cup of cold
water; pour coffee into the cup and back
again to pot. Let it stand a few minutes.</p>


<h3>To make Mead.</h3>

<p>One pint and a half of brown sugar, half
a pint of molasses. Pour on this three
pints of boiling water. Let this stand till
blood warm, then add two ounces of tartaric
acid and one of essence of sassafras.</p>

<p>When cold, bottle.</p>


<h3>To use Mead.</h3>

<p>Put one tablespoonful of the mead in the
bottom of a glass, then fill two-thirds full
of cold water, then stir in one-fourth of a
teaspoonful of soda, and drink while foaming.
Make mead before leaving home.</p>

<h2>FOR THE SICK.</h2>


<h3>Rice Water for Diarrhœa.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Put</span> one cup of rice into the frypan, and
stir over the fire until it is a dark brown.
If convenient, after it has been browned,
pound it. Take half a cup of the rice, and
pour over it nearly one quart of water, and
let it stand on the stove twenty minutes;
then strain, and add boiled milk and sugar
to taste. Drink freely of this.</p>


<h3>Flour Gruel.</h3>

<p>Let one quart of fresh milk come to a
boil, and then stir in one tablespoonful of
flour, which has been mixed with milk
enough to make a smooth paste; boil this
mixture thirty minutes, being careful not to
let it burn. Season with salt, and strain.
The patient should be kept warm and quiet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>


<h3>Oat Meal Gruel.</h3>

<p>Into one quart of boiling water, sprinkle
two tablespoonfuls of oatmeal; let this boil
sixty minutes; season with salt, strain, and
serve. If sugar, milk, or cream is wished,
it may be added.</p>


<h3>Indian Meal Gruel.</h3>

<p>One quart of boiling water; stir into
this one spoonful of flour and two of Indian
meal, mixed with a little cold water. Boil
thirty minutes. Season with salt, and
strain. Use sugar and cream if you choose.
If flour is not liked, use another spoonful
of meal instead.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
